# HAQA
HAQA is A Hardware-Guided and Fidelity-Aware Strategy for Efficient Qubit Mapping Optimization, the main contribution of HAQA is:

1. **Introduced a hardware-oriented region identification mechanism**  
   A community-based iterative region identification strategy was developed, leveraging quantum hardware connectivity to reduce mapping space dimensionality and avoid global search processes.

2. **Proposed a hardware-characteristic-based region evaluation mechanism**  
   Enabled quantitative selection of mapping regions based on fidelity metrics, addressing the limitations of existing solvers in considering hardware fidelity characteristics.

3. **Demonstrated polynomial-level acceleration potential**  
   Provided computational complexity analysis showing significant theoretical acceleration in qubit mapping processes while adapting to increasingly complex quantum hardware architectures.
